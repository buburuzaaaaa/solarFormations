    <p>The star formation starts in the centers of dense molecular clouds. The first step is the initial collapse of an interstellar cloud. If the cloud cools quickly enough then gravity will cause a contraction and some sort of subsequent collapse. The second step is that the cold cloud fragments turn into clumps. This step is related to turbulence in the cloud thats collapsing. A regular interstellar cloud is supported against collapse from internal motions. The third step is the clumps collapsing into the stars. As soon as the gravities force gets stronger than the pressure supporting the clumps, the collapse happens really fast. Over time as the gas gets sufficiently compressed that its dense and heated up enough so that the pressure balanced the gravitational force. They call these protostars. After the initial collapse the prototstar might still be surrounded by a remnant of the cloud from which it formed.</p>
