    <p>Stars form inside relatively dense concentrations of interstellar gas and dust known as molecular clouds. These regions
    are extremely cold. Temperatures range from 10 to 20 K, just above absolute zero. When it reaches such low temperatures,
    the gases become molecular or it means that the atoms bind together.Since the regions are dancing, opaque to visible
    light, and known as dark nebulae since they don't glow in optical light, we must use IR and radio telescopes to
    investigate them.Star formation begins when the denser parts of the Cloud Core collapses under its own
    weight/gravity.The cores are denser than the Outer Cloud, so they accumulate first when the course collapses and
    fragment into groups around 0.1 parsecs in size and 10 to 50 solar masses in mass. These clumps then form into
    protostars and the whole process takes about 10 million years.</p>
