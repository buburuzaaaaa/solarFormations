    <p>Scientists and astronomers believe the theory called protoplanet hypothesis which is the idea that small items stuck
    together and overtime they continuously grew big enough to form plantsAccording to theory, 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system as we know it today was nothing more than a small
    collection of gas and dust, which is why they call it a nebula and believe that something caused an explosion by causing
    a cloud to collapse. and that they made a disk out of a bunch of different materials they think in the center of the
    disk there was a pressure build up that caused some of the hydrogen atoms to come into contact with time they came
    together and formed helium to drive the formation of the sun after the formation of the Sun on top of 99% of everything
    around it, but the other 1% that was still available led to the formation of the other planets, the rocky planets are
    closer to the Sun and the gas giants are more far from the Sun around 400 billion years ago there was a theory called
    the late heavy bombardment. This theory is that we almost miss the earth when an object as big as Mars collides with it.
    The biggest challenge to these theories is that there is no one there to record or see what really happened.</p>
